# 📦 Order Fulfilment Optimization

### Streamline Logistics Solutions

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Order Fulfilment Optimization Project** was developed to improve operational efficiency at **Streamline Logistics Solutions** through data-driven analysis, interactive dashboards, and automated KPI reporting.

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* Reduce order backlogs
* Improve delivery punctuality
* Enhance customer satisfaction
* Provide management with real-time operational visibility
* Enable proactive, data-driven decision-making

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

Analysis of operational data reveals significant fulfilment challenges:

* **Order fulfilment rate:** 49%
* **Backlog rate:** 51%
* **Average delivery delay:** 14.5 minutes

Customer sentiment highlights growing dissatisfaction:

* **35% Negative**
* **33% Neutral**
* **32% Positive**

The high proportion of neutral feedback represents a critical risk segment that may shift toward dissatisfaction if fulfilment delays persist. Demand is unevenly distributed across routes, zones, days, and allocation rules, creating operational bottlenecks that directly contribute to backlog accumulation.

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 🚚 Order Fulfilment & Customer Experience

* Fulfilment performance indicates **systemic inefficiencies**, with more delayed orders than completed ones.
* Average delays exceed acceptable service thresholds.
* Customer feedback skews unfavorably, signaling declining service perception.

### 🛣️ Route & Zone Utilization

**Route Distribution**

* Route 5: **21.27%**
* Route 2: **21.13%**
* Routes 1, 3, 4: ~**19%** each (underutilized)

**Zone Distribution**

* Zone 1: **34.60%**
* Zone 2: **34.53%**
* Zone 3: **30.87%**

Zones 1 and 2 collectively handle nearly **70% of demand**, placing sustained operational pressure on these areas.

### ⚙️ Allocation Rules & Demand Patterns

**Order Allocation**

* Standard: **34.20%**
* Custom: **33.93%**
* Expedited: **31.87%**

**Demand Timing**

* Fridays account for **24.13%** of total orders.
* Wednesdays, Thursdays, and weekends show consistently high volumes.
* Mondays and Tuesdays (~11%) reflect underutilized capacity.

### 🚨 Backlog-Specific Insights

**Backlogs by Zone**

* Zone 2: **36.38%**
* Zone 1: **34.03%**
* Zone 3: **29.60%**

**Backlogs by Route**

* Routes 5 & 2: ~**21%** each
* Route 1: **19%**
* Routes 3 & 4: **18%**

**Vehicle Contribution**

* Vans: **36%**
* Bikes: **32.99%**
* Trucks: **30.90%**

**Customer Feedback on Backlogged Orders**

* Neutral feedback is highest
* Negative: **34.40%**
* Positive: **31.68%**

## 💡 Recommendations

### 1️⃣ Rebalance Route & Zone Workloads

Redistribute orders from overutilized Routes 5 and 2 to underutilized Routes 1, 3, and 4. Introduce flexible capacity buffers in Zones 1 and 2.

### 2️⃣ Optimize Allocation Rules

Refine **standard allocation logic**, which contributes the highest backlog share. Implement dynamic escalation rules triggered by real-time backlog thresholds.

### 3️⃣ Address Friday Peak Bottlenecks

Increase fleet availability, staffing levels, and dispatch frequency on Fridays to reduce backlog accumulation.

### 4️⃣ Improve Fleet Utilization

Review van operations, as vans account for the largest share of backlogs. Optimize route-to-vehicle matching and load distribution.

### 5️⃣ Strengthen Customer Experience

Introduce proactive communication for delayed orders, especially for neutral customers. Implement real-time delay alerts and resolution workflows.

### 6️⃣ Shift Early-Week Demand

Encourage order placement and delivery scheduling on Mondays and Tuesdays to smooth demand across the week.

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Deploy automated dashboards to track fulfilment rate, backlog volume, delay time, and customer feedback in real time.
* Configure alert thresholds for high-risk routes, zones, and days.
* Pilot revised allocation rules and route redistribution strategies.
* Monitor KPI improvements weekly and evaluate impact on delivery punctuality and customer satisfaction.
* Use insights to guide decisions on fleet expansion, staffing, and cost optimization.
